# Pull Request Creation Command

Create a pull request following the project's PR template and conventions.

This command supports both **cloned** repositories (direct push access) and **forked**
repositories (contributor forks).

## Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

### 1. Gather Context

Run these commands in parallel to gather context:

```bash
# Get current branch name
git branch --show-current

# Get commits on this branch (since diverging from main)
git log main..HEAD --oneline

# Check for uncommitted changes
git status --short

# Check repository fork status and get parent info
gh repo view --json isFork,parent,nameWithOwner
```

Stop if `git branch --show-current` returns the default branch: a PR opens from a
feature branch, and every diff below is scoped to what that branch adds — on
`main` they all come back empty and step 3 has no issue number to parse.

### 2. Determine Repository Topology

Analyze the `gh repo view` output to determine the workflow type:

**Cloned repository (direct access):**

```json
{
  "isFork": false,
  "nameWithOwner": "knight-owl-dev/prettier-plugin-pandoc",
  "parent": null
}
```

**Forked repository (contributor fork):**

```json
{
  "isFork": true,
  "nameWithOwner": "alice/prettier-plugin-pandoc",
  "parent": {
    "name": "prettier-plugin-pandoc",
    "owner": { "login": "knight-owl-dev" }
  }
}
```

Store these values for later steps:

- `is_fork`: boolean from `isFork`
- `fork_owner`: extract from `nameWithOwner` (e.g., "alice" from "alice/prettier-plugin-pandoc")
- `upstream_repo`: if fork, use `parent.owner.login/parent.name`; otherwise use `nameWithOwner`

### 3. Extract Issue Reference

Parse the branch name to extract the issue number:

- Branch format: `<issue-number>-<title-slug>` (e.g.,
  `31-add-claude-code-command-for-creating-pull-requests-via-gh-cli`)
- Extract the leading number as the issue reference
- If no issue number is found, ask the user if this PR relates to an issue

### 4. Fetch Issue Details

If an issue number was found, fetch the issue to understand the scope:

```bash
gh issue view <issue-number> --repo knight-owl-dev/prettier-plugin-pandoc
```

Use the issue's Goal, Scope, and context to inform the PR summary.

### 5. Analyze Commits

Review the git log output to understand what changes were made:

- Group related commits conceptually
- Identify the high-level changes (not commit-by-commit detail)
- Focus on what behavior/functionality changed

### 6. Offer Pre-PR Reviews

Surface the review commands before drafting — they are easy to forget when
reviewing by hand, and running them now folds any fixes into the branch (one
clean PR, no follow-up "fix" commits chasing an open PR, no extra CI round).

Choose what to offer from the diff (`git diff main...HEAD --stat`):

- **Touches code** (`packages/`, `test/`, `.github/`, `Makefile`) — offer `/code-review` (correctness: logic and edge-case bugs).
  This is the pass most easily missed by hand and the one CI will not run.
- **Docs/comment-only** — offer to skip; correctness is not `/code-review`'s
  lane on prose.
- **Trivial one-liner** — offer to skip.

Use AskUserQuestion, defaulting to the offer that matches the diff and always
allowing skip:

- Question: "Run a review before opening the PR?"
- Options: "Run /code-review" (correctness), "Skip — already reviewed".

If a review runs, present its findings, apply the accepted fixes, and re-stage
before continuing.

### 7. Determine Labels

Based on the issue labels and commit content, recommend applicable labels:

| Label             | When to suggest                        |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `bug`             | Fixes something broken                 |
| `enhancement`     | New feature or improvement             |
| `documentation`   | Documentation-only changes             |
| `security`        | Security-related fixes or improvements |
| `breaking-change` | Changes that break existing behavior   |
| `dependencies`    | Dependency updates                     |
| `pandoc-blocks`   | Block recognition changes              |
| `prettier-plugin` | Plugin changes                         |

If the related issue has labels, prefer to match them.

### 8. Draft PR Content

Follow the PR template (`.github/pull_request_template.md`):

**Formatting**: Write paragraphs as flowing text without hard line breaks. GitHub's
markdown renderer handles wrapping automatically. Only use line breaks between sections
or for bullet lists. Keep it laconic and load-bearing — state the change and why,
nothing more; cut flourish and drama.

```markdown
## Summary

[Describe the outcome this PR delivers, derived from the issue's Goal.
Focus on the WHY, not the HOW. Use flowing prose, not bullets.]

## Related Issues

[Use "Refs #NN" or "Fixes #NN" based on whether PR fully completes the issue]

Refs #<issue-number>

## Changes

[High-level bullets derived from analyzing commits. Avoid commit-level detail.
Group related changes conceptually.]

- [Change 1]
- [Change 2]
- [Change 3]

## Further Comments

[Optional: testing notes, migration steps, or anything reviewers should know.
Omit this section if not needed.]
```

### 9. Generate PR Title

Create an outcome-focused title that:

- Describes what the PR achieves (not what it does)
- Uses imperative mood ("Add...", "Enable...", "Fix...")
- Matches the issue title style when applicable
- Is concise (50-72 characters preferred)
- **Does NOT include issue references** (e.g., avoid `Fix bug (#42)`)—GitHub automatically
  appends the PR number during squash merge; issue linking belongs in the body via `Refs #NN`
  or `Fixes #NN`

### 10. Preview and Confirm

Show the user a preview of:

- Title
- Labels
- Full body content

Use AskUserQuestion to confirm before creating, with options to:

- Create the PR as shown
- Edit the title
- Edit the content
- Add/remove labels

### 11. Push Branch if Needed

Check if the branch has been pushed to remote:

```bash
git status -sb
```

If there is no upstream, push with tracking. If the branch is ahead of its
upstream — which it will be after committing a changelog entry — push too:

```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>   # no upstream
git push                           # upstream exists, local is ahead
```

This works for both workflows:

- **Clone**: `origin` is the main repository
- **Fork**: `origin` is the user's fork (correct destination for PR branches)

### 12. Create the Pull Request

Use gh CLI to create the PR. The `--head` flag format differs based on repository topology.

**For cloned repositories** (direct access):

Use a separate `--label` flag for each label.

```bash
gh pr create \
  --repo knight-owl-dev/prettier-plugin-pandoc \
  --base main \
  --head <branch-name> \
  --label "<label-1>" \
  --label "<label-2>" \
  --title "<title>" \
  --body "<body>"
```

**For forked repositories** (contributor fork):

```bash
gh pr create \
  --repo knight-owl-dev/prettier-plugin-pandoc \
  --base main \
  --head <fork-owner>:<branch-name> \
  --label "<label-1>" \
  --label "<label-2>" \
  --title "<title>" \
  --body "<body>"
```

The `--head` flag must include the fork owner prefix (e.g., `alice:my-feature-branch`) so
GitHub knows which fork contains the branch.

### 13. Output

After successful creation:

- Display the PR URL
- Ask if the user wants to open it in browser:

  ```bash
  gh pr view <pr-number> --repo knight-owl-dev/prettier-plugin-pandoc --web
  ```

### Error Handling

- **On the default branch**: Stop — there is no feature branch to open a PR from
- **Uncommitted changes**: Warn the user and ask if they want to commit first
- **No commits**: Inform user there are no changes to create a PR for
- **Branch not pushed**: Offer to push the branch automatically
- **PR already exists**: Show the existing PR URL instead
- **Fork not synced**: If the fork's main branch is behind upstream, suggest syncing first
- **Head reference not found**: Likely missing fork owner prefix. Verify topology detection
